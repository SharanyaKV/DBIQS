# DBIQS
DBIQS - An Intelligent System for Querying and Mining Databases using NLP

DEFINITION OF THE PROBLEM :
In recent times, there is a rising demand for a system which allows non-expert users to query the relational databases in a more natural way, i.e., in their own natural language instead of querying it in a complex database language like SQL. Our project mainly concentrates on developing a Database Intelligent Querying System (DBIQS) which portrays completely automatic, simple, fast and reliable way to query a database.

RELEVANCE AND IMPACT OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT :
Retrieving meaningful information from large repositories which collect and store the huge data in its proper format requires an extensive knowledge of database languages like SQL. However, not everybody is able to write the complex SQL queries to extract the needful information. This intricate problem can be solved to a great extent by providing a Natural Language Interface to the users using which they can query a database in their own language. In this project, we propose a Database Intelligent Querying System (DBIQS) which portrays completely automatic, simple, fast and reliable way to query a database.


METHODOLOGY/ WORK PLAN :
The project work can be modularised to Semantic building, MR Generation, Query Generation, Data Mining. The semantic builder works on the semantic layer and intelligently processes and extracts this information to build up the semantic map. The Meaningful Representation (MR) which comprises of one or more tokens and relationships between them. A Query Generator generates final SQL queries by mapping MR to semantic information. DBIQS implies some Data Mining and Data Warehousing techniques which allow users to create tailored views.
We are planning to use NLP based text recognition algorithm that . First a semantic map is created by preprocessing the database schema. A meaningful representation is created from natural language query using the Wordnet database. The mapping is done between them and the database query is generated. 
We are planning to  evaluate the efficiency of this system on ATIS database(Air Travel Information System) using the available corpus of text queries.
